# About Me

---

Hello! I’m Alli Beck, and I’m a senior majoring in Graphic Design with a minor in Marketing here at Taylor. I enjoyed spending my summer on some freelance design projects, and this year, and am continuing to develop my skills this year by serving as a Presidential Fellow in Holly Whitby’s office, the Vice President of Marketing and Enrollment. I’m looking forward to learning a lot in the marketing conversation specifically in the higher ed context, as I hope and plan for what’s next in my career!

# Personal

---

I enjoy being outside in God’s creation, whether it’s running, camping, or exploring. Although since I currently reside in the cornfields for most of the year, a chunk of my free time goes to Pinterest and TripAdvisor instead. Other than that, you can probably find me cooking or decorating for the week’s informal dinner party!

- I’ve loved my Graphic Design classes here at Taylor! My favorite so far has been Product ID, which I took second semester of Junior year. We got to rebrand an existing Ice Cream brand, with complete creative freedom and involvement in every detail, from the visual identity to the marketing launch. It made me excited for my future in design and marketing, where I get to do things that feel like play for work!
